  This function receives an object and returns the number 
  of key-value pairs (properties) in the object.

  This function receives an object, whose values will all be numbers, and returns the smallest number in the object.
*/

/*
  This function receives an object, whose values will all be numbers, and returns the largest number in the object.
*/

/*
  This function receives an object, and will return a clone of this object - i.e. a new object with the same key-value pairs.
*/

/*
  This function receives an object and returns the value for the given key.
  If the key does not exist it returns undefined.
*/

  This function will receive an object and a key, and will return true if the object has the given key, and false if not.

  This function receives an object, whose values will all be numbers, and returns the sum of all these numbers.

  This function receives an object and will return a new object with the keys and values inverted. See the tests for examples of this.

/*
  This function allows you to find a value from an object which fulfils a criteria. It receives an object and a matcher function. It should test each value in the object against the matcher function and if a matching value is found, the value should be returned. Otherwise, return null.

/*
  This function allows you to test whether some values in an object match a certain criteria. For example, are at least some of the values greater than 100? The function receives an object and a tester function. If at least 1 of the values in the object pass the tester function, true is returned. Otherwise, return false.
